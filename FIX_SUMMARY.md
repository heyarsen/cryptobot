# Critical Fixes: Account Persistence and Message Delivery

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Account Persistence After Deployment** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** When the bot was redeployed or restarted, it lost track of which user owned which account. This prevented automatic restoration of monitoring sessions.

**Root Cause:** The `AccountConfig` dataclass and database schema didn't include a `user_id` field to track account ownership.

**Solution:**
- Added `user_id: int` field to `AccountConfig` dataclass
- Added `user_id INTEGER` column to the accounts table
- Added migration code to support existing databases
- Updated account creation to save the user_id
- Updated `set_current_account()` to persist user_id to database

### 2. **Message Delivery from Monitored Channels** ❌ → ✅
**Problem:** After deployment, messages from monitored channels weren't being received, and orders weren't being opened.

**Root Cause:** The `auto_start_monitoring()` function tried to access `account.user_id` which didn't exist, causing the monitoring to fail silently on startup.

**Solution:**
- Auto-start monitoring now correctly uses the persisted user_id
- Accounts without user_id are gracefully skipped with informative logs
- Monitoring is automatically restored for all accounts with configured channels

## Changes Made

### Database Schema Changes
```sql
ALTER TABLE accounts ADD COLUMN user_id INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

### Code Changes

1. **AccountConfig dataclass** (line 197)
   - Added `user_id: int = 0` field

2. **Database initialization** (lines 494, 520-522)
   - Added user_id to CREATE TABLE statement
   - Added ALTER TABLE migration for existing databases

3. **create_account method** (lines 647-658)
   - Updated INSERT statement to include user_id
   - Added user_id to the values tuple

4. **get_all_accounts method** (lines 698-739)
   - Updated column indices to account for new user_id field
   - Properly reads and returns user_id from database

5. **Account creation handlers** (lines 3276, 4973-4982)
   - Both account creation flows now save user_id

6. **New method: update_account_user_id** (lines 899-911)
   - Allows updating user_id for existing accounts
   - Used for migration of old accounts

7. **set_current_account method** (lines 1650-1651)
   - Now persists user_id to database when account is selected
   - Ensures old accounts get migrated automatically

8. **auto_start_monitoring function** (lines 5223-5235)
   - Checks if account has valid user_id before starting
   - Properly restores current_accounts mapping
   - Logs informative messages for accounts without user_id

## Benefits

✅ **Automatic Monitoring Restoration**: After deployment/restart, monitoring automatically resumes for all accounts with configured channels

✅ **Account Persistence**: User-account associations are now permanently stored in the database

✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Existing databases are automatically migrated with the new user_id column

✅ **Graceful Degradation**: Accounts without user_id (old accounts) are handled gracefully and will be migrated when user selects them

✅ **Better Logging**: Clear log messages show which accounts are being restored and why some are skipped

## Migration Path for Existing Accounts

For existing accounts in the database (with user_id = 0):
1. When a user next selects an account, `set_current_account()` will automatically update the user_id
2. After that, the account will be included in auto-start monitoring on future deployments
3. No manual intervention required

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test account creation with new accounts
2. Test deployment restart with existing configured accounts
3. Verify message delivery from monitored channels after restart
4. Verify orders are opened correctly after restart
5. Test with old accounts to ensure they get migrated when selected

## Technical Details

**Column Shift**: Since user_id was inserted at position 7 (after phone), all subsequent column indices in `get_all_accounts()` needed to be incremented by 1.

**Default Value**: user_id defaults to 0 to maintain backward compatibility and allow easy identification of unmigrated accounts.

**Persistence Strategy**: The user_id is updated in two places:
1. During account creation (immediate)
2. During account selection (lazy migration for old accounts)
