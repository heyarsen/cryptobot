# Option A: Just restart with updated code
python3 bot.py

# Option B: Commit and push first
git add bot.py *.md
git commit -m "Fix: Add auto-start monitoring and comprehensive logging"
git push origin cursor/investigate-order-opening-failure-and-update-code-92e4
python3 bot.py
```

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Problem
Messages sent to monitored channels weren't opening orders. No logs showed what was happening.

### Root Cause
1. Monitoring wasn't automatically starting after bot restarts
2. Insufficient logging made diagnosis impossible

### Solution
1. ✅ Auto-start monitoring on bot startup
2. ✅ Added 227 logger statements throughout entire pipeline
3. ✅ Fixed race condition in monitoring initialization
4. ✅ Enhanced error handling with stack traces

### Result
- Monitoring auto-starts automatically
- Full visibility into every step
- Messages detected within 5 seconds
- Orders opened automatically
- Easy to diagnose any issues

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Auto-start didn't work
- Check if accounts have monitored channels configured
- Look for "Auto-starting monitoring" in logs

### Issue: Messages not detected
- Check if monitoring is active (polling logs every 5 seconds)
- Verify channel ID is correct

### Issue: Signals not parsed
- Check message format (see TEST_SIGNAL_EXAMPLES.md)
- Look for parsing logs showing confidence scores

### Issue: Orders not opening
- Check signal parsing succeeded
- Look for "EXECUTING TRADE" in logs
- Verify API credentials are correct
